# Challenge 1

## Description

The motivation for this project was to enrich the understanding of semantic HTML by providing code that was made without semantics in mind. This process of correction required adequate research about what all semantic HTML is all about in order to better approach the necessary adjustments. I learned that sematic HTML is a way of writing your code with intention so that each tag used on your code is specified to its contents. This specification is beneficial to not only other people reading your code, in laying out your code, but also in adding accessibility to your code. Semantics allows for your unclear div to transform into a more clear: header or footer, which is useful for accessibility purposes because readers now have a reference for what to deliver to those that need it. 

Overall, this project was a lot of fun and I did struggle quite a bit but things turned around when I took the time to really understand semantics and then took even more time in setting up comments throughout all the code to ensure i wasn't missing anything before diving in and finally making those changes!
